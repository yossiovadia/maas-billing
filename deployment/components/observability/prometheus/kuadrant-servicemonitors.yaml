# Authorino ServiceMonitor for standalone Prometheus deployments.
#
# Deployment path: Standalone Prometheus stack (deployment/components/observability/prometheus/).
# Deployed by: kustomize build of this directory
# Scraped by:  Standalone Prometheus in llm-observability namespace
#
# Scrapes both /metrics (controller-runtime) and /server-metrics (auth evaluation).
#
# NOT a duplicate of deployment/base/observability/authorino-server-metrics-servicemonitor.yaml.
# That file is for the OpenShift user-workload monitoring path (install-observability.sh).
# The two ServiceMonitors serve different deployment scenarios and are never active on
# the same cluster simultaneously.
